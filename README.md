# Movie Data

Collects data about the movies that I've watched, such as the director count, box office, genre, etc.

Originally done in [C#](https://github.com/rzhou10/Movie-Data), but redone in Python because I can't get the original to work on Ubuntu :/. Can't work without Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel, which can only run on Windows. I doubt they'll add it, so this is what I have to do.

Because why not? I've already gotten everything here, might as well. Check the Excel if you want to see the new list. I still won't be updating anything (the code) like the previous project, so if you still want to use it, I can send over the Excel.
